==============================
N TO N & BRIDGING TABLES
==============================

Exists when each record from table A can be associated with multiple records
in table B, and vice versa.

Examples:

1.Imagine a library: a single book (one) can be borrowed by multiple users (many),
and vice versa, a user (one) can borrow multiple books (many).
2.Students and courses (a student takes many courses, and a course has many
students).
3.Actors and movies (an actor stars in many movies, and a movie features many
actors).
4.Products and categories (a product belongs to multiple categories, and a
category holds multiple products).


NOTE: a traditional table structure can't directly represent n:n relationships,
we introduce a bridging table.

---------------------
BRIDGING TABLES 
---------------------

This table act as a link between the tables. It contains:

1. FK: Each column in the bridging table references a primary key from one of the
original tables.

2. Additional info: Depending on your needs, you can add additional columns to
capture information about the relationship itself. 

NOTE: A BRIDGING TABLE CAN CONNECT AN ENTITY WITH ANOTHER BRIDGING TABLE.

Example: 
Passanger-|--------<-Viajes-|---------|-Trayectos->------Estaciones
                                                 ->------Trenes
