==============================
TABLES
==============================

Its the container and structure of the information.

---------------------
TABLE COMMANDS
---------------------

- CREATE: It creates the empty table.
- ALTER: modifies the table content.
- DROP: deletes the table and its content.

---------------------
PG ADMIN - DATABASE
---------------------

The process for creating a new table in PG ADMIN is listed as it follows:

1. Open Pg Admin and input the passwd.
2. When creating the database by right click over "Databases", an emergent
window will display the options for the database and the SQL code in a tab.

´´´sql
CREATE DATABASE transportation
  WITH
  OWNER = postgres
  ENCODING = 'UTF8'
  LOCALE_PROVIDER = 'libc'
  CONNECTION LIMIT = -1
  IS_TEMPLATE = False;
´´´

- Creates a database named transportation.
- It sets the database owner to postgres, uses UTF-8 encoding and libc for locale
support, allows unlimited connections, and is not a template database.

KEY POINTS:

a. WITH block allows you to customize database properties, but it's not always
required. ----> SQL shells often apply default values for convenience.

b. SQL commands are the same regardless of the interface you use(MySQL, PostGres).

c. It's recommended to explicitly specify properties to ensure your database is
configured as intended.

---------------------
PG ADMIN - TABLE
---------------------

1. When DB is created -> go to 'Tables' -> right click -> 'Create'.
2. 'general' tab -> name the table with the entity name.
3. 'columns' tab -> we create each table's columns, its data types, the length,
and its constraints.
4. 'Constrains' tab -> Here we set the PK. Its important to name it:
pk_<tablename>.

´´´sql
CREATE TABLE public.passengers
(
    id serial,
    name character varying(80),
    email character varying,
    birth_date date,
    CONSTRAINT pk_passengers PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS public.passengers
    OWNER to postgres;
´´´
- 'public.passengers' statement explicitly places the table within the public 
    schema. Now its access/permissions/visibility are determined by public schema.
- Ownership to postgres user states full control over the public schema elements.

---------------------
TABLE COMMANDS
---------------------

1. Right click over the table. -> Scripts -> OPTIONS:

- CREATE: generates the CREATE TABLE script (used to create it). For copying
    and info purposes (We cant create tables inside tables).
- SELECT: Retrieves data from table.
- INSERT: allows you to add new rows to the table by providing a template.
- UPDATE: lets you modify existing data in the table.
- DELETE: removes ROWS from table.

---------------------
PGADMIN - INSERT ON TABLE 
---------------------

1. Right click over the table. -> Scripts -> iNSERT Script:

´´´sql
INSERT INTO public.passengers(
	id, name, email, birth_date)
	VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?);
´´´

- It will facilitate us the coding from scratch.
- ID field can be deleted as it autocompletes with serial non-repetitive values.
- We must to replace the '?' with the row's info. Use ''.
- 'birth_date' column has a certain date format. For correct inputs we have to
    consult the date format:

´´´sql
SELECT current_date;
´´´
- Retrieves the date format.
