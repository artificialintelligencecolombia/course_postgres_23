DATABASE BACKUP
==============================


Prepare Environment
---------------

1. Verify PostgreSQL service is running:
  - Open the Services app (you can search for "Services" in the Start menu).
  - Find PostgreSQL in the list of services.
  - Ensure its status is Running. If it's not running, right-click on it and select Start.


Select a backup location
---------------

In this case, the backup location is:
C:\Users\damal\living_antioquia\databases

Navigate to PostgreSQL's bin Directory
---------------

1. Open the Command Prompt as an administrator.
2. Navigate to the directory where PostgreSQL's pg_dump utility is located.
  - cd "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin"

Create the Full Backup
---------------

pg_dump -U dbuser -d business_db -F c -b -v -f "C:\path\to\backup\directory\business_db_full_backup.sql"

Explanation of options:
-U dbuser: Specifies the PostgreSQL user. -> psql: SELECT current_user;
-d business_db: Specifies the database to backup.
-F c: Specifies the custom format for the backup file.
-b: Includes large objects in the dump.
-v: Verbose mode for detailed output.
-f "C:\path\to\backup\directory\business_db_full_backup.sql": Specifies the filename and location of the backup.

Note:
> The password the pg_dump command asks for is the -U postgres password (the postgres password).

Verify the backup file
---------------

1. Navigate to the specified directory where the backup file is located.

2. pg_restore -l "C:\path\to\backup\directory\business_db_full_backup.sql"
  - pg_restore: This is the command-line utility used to restore a PostgreSQL database from a dump file created by pg_dump.
  - l: This option tells pg_restore to list the contents of the archive file. Instead of actually restoring the data, it outputs a list of the items in the backup file, which can include tables, indexes, functions, and other database objects.
