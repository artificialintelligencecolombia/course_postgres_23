Postgres features
---------------------

1. Postgres is constantly updated by the developers community, as an Open Source
project.

2. Uses Objeto.Relational structure, so de dbs are related as objects (with keys,
inheritance). So the tables are related among them.

3. PostGIS is a geolocalization service. We can use it in postgres.

4. PL/PgSQL is for programming inside SQL language.

5.
A: atomicidad. Split the fns on the DB into smaller tasks. For troubleshooting.
C: consistencia. Tables are related with keys + so both are congruents. 
I: isolation. Multitasking in the same DB. Functions isolated. 
D: durabilidad. If server fails, the info wont lost. It has a bitacora system for
back up.
