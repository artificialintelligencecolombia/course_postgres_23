JOIN
==============================

Join queries are those  that access multiple tables (or multiple
instances of the same table).

1. Example
SELECT *
    FROM weather JOIN cities ON city = name;

2. Example
SELECT city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date, location
    FROM weather JOIN cities ON city = name;

3. Example
SELECT weather.city, weather.temp_lo, weather.temp_hi,
    weather.prcp, weather.date, cities.location
    FROM weather JOIN cities ON weather.city = cities.name;
